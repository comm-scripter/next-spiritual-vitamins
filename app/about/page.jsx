      <p>HOW THE SPIRITUAL VITAMINS DEVELOPED</p>
      <p>
        While reading my Devotions one morning about 2 years ago I heard a voice
        (yes, it was audible for me) say, “Get my Word out!” I understood it to
        be God speaking to me. It was not a dream as I was wide awake. I
        answered and said, “Lord, I am a nobody. I am not a preacher nor do I
        teach women or children in church. How can I get Your Word out?”
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        Looking back on the event that was a pretty stupid thing to say. Did I
        think God didn’t know who He was talking to? He repeated, “Get my Word
        out”. Later I told my husband about the encounter and we discussed
        possibilities. After prayer we decided to produce a form of what we call
        “Spiritual Vitamins”.

        The original vitamins were made of construction paper shaped like a
        capsule. They contained a Title, Date and Scripture verse, all hand
        lettered, and colored . I mailed 20 copies to my family members and it
        took me 30 days to create 20 vitamins. They were not fancy at all.

        Months later my husband offered the idea that he could print the
        vitamins on cardstock on the computer, in color and even find computer
        art work for the front. I added an additional Quote on the back side.
        This continued until recently when our son designed a web page to
        include all past, present and future vitamins.

        As any labor of love, our family has put our whole heart into sharing
        Biblical truths in a way that can get the Word out to everyone who is
        interested. We hope that the Spiritual Vitamin Site is a blessing to
        you, your family, and friends.
