        “Dear God, I know I’m a sinner, and I ask for your forgiveness. I
        believe Jesus Christ is Your Son. I believe that He died for my sin and
        that you raised Him to life. I want to trust Him as my Savior and follow
        Him as Lord, from this day forward. Guide my life and help me to do your
        will. I pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.”
